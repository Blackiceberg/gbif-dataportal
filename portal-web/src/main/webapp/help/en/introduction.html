<p>Welcome to the Data Portal of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  For an introduction to the capabilities of the Portal, see the <a href="tutorial">online tutorial</a>.  A <a href="http://www.gbif.fr/?q=fr/node/124">French translation</a> is also available.</p>

<p>GBIF is an international organisation that is working to make the world's biodiversity data accessible everywhere in the world. GBIF and its many partners work to mobilise the data, and to improve search mechanisms, data and metadata standards, web services, and the other components of an Internet-based information infrastructure for biodiversity.</p>

<p>For more information about GBIF as an organisation, visit our home page at <a href="http://www.gbif.org/">www.gbif.org</a>.</p>

<p>GBIF makes available data that are shared by hundreds of data providers from around the world.  These data are shared according to the <a href="datauseagreement">GBIF Data Use Agreement</a>, which includes the provision that users of any GBIF data will always give credit to the original providers.</p>
