= How To Build =

The following instructions will guide you through the compiling, packaging and deployment instructions for the data portal's web application.

== 1. Checking out the source code ==

The web application consists of 4 projects:
 * portal-core
 * portal-index
 * portal-service
 * portal-web

The instructions for checking out from Google Code's SVN can be found [http://code.google.com/p/gbif-dataportal/source/checkout here]

== 2. Building and packaging the project ==

If you need to build the web application for the first time, you need to execute the script *first-build-all.sh* found on the portal-web project (portal-web/first-build-all.sh)

After the first build, you may use the *build-all.sh* (portal-web/build-all.sh)

After this is done, there will be a *portal.war* that has been generated to be deployed on an application server. 

== 3. Creating the index backend database ==

The data portal needs a database where it stores all its data. 

On the portal-core project there are two files:

 * portal-core/db/portal.ddl : Used for building the initial structure of the database
 * portal-core/db/initPortal.data: For populating the database with initial needed for the web application to run

The steps that need to be followed are:

 # mysql> create database portal;
 # mysql -u [username] -p[password] < PATH_TO_PORTAL_WEB/db/portal.ddl
 # mysql -u [username] -p[password] < PATH_TO_PORTAL_WEB/db/initPortal.ddl

== 4. Deploy and link the web application with the index database ==

To deploy the web application you have build you need to take the portal.war file (found at portal-web/target/portal.war) and place it into the webapplication folders in your application server. In [http://tomcat.apache.org Tomcat] this will be found at TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/. You might need to start your application server in order to _expand_ the WAR file.

Once you have your web application into your application server, you need to *link* the data portal with the created index database. To do this you need to go into your _expanded_ web application folder to the following file:

TOMCAT_HOME/portal/WEB-INF/classes/portal.properties



In here you will find the following code, which you need to configure according to your database settings:

`# Portal index credentials`

`dataSource.username=root`

`dataSource.password=`

`dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/portal?autoReconnect=true&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF8&characterSetResults=UTF8`



`# Portal indexer database credentials`

`harvestingDataSource.username=root`

`harvestingDataSource.password=`

`harvestingDataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/portal?autoReconnect=true&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF8&characterSetResults=UTF8`



`# Database credentials for the database that is used for writing the log entries `
`logDataSource.username=root`

`logDataSource.password=`

`logDataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/portal?autoReconnect=true&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF8&characterSetResults=UTF8`



After doing this you should be able to access your newly created data portal at [http://localhost:8080 http://localhost:8080]
